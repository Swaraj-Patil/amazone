# Amazone: Amazon Clone - MERN E-Commerce Website

### Visit: [Live Site](https://amazonee.vercel.app/)

Hi! My name is **Swaraj**, and I have created this **Amazon Clone** website to learn the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It's a fake e-commerce site built for educational purposes.
